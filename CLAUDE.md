# Claude Code Project Memory

This repository is a TypeScript/React project with an Express backend for bond calculations and analytics.

@docs/ADDING_BONDS.md

## Development
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run the dev server using `npm run dev`.
- Run TypeScript checks with `npm run check` before committing.
- Use `npm run build` to ensure the project builds without errors.

## Style
- Use standard TypeScript style. Keep variable and file names in kebab-case or camelCase as appropriate.
- Preferred formatting is Prettier-compatible (no explicit config yet).

## Bond Data
- When editing or creating bond templates, review `docs/ADDING_BONDS.md` for field conventions and required checklist items.

## Commits and PRs
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Summarize your changes in the pull request description.

# BOND CALCULATOR AGENT PRINCIPLES

## üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE üö®

**ALL BOND INFORMATION MUST BE JSON-FIRST WITH EXOGENOUS VARIABLES ONLY**

### Core Principle:
- **Bond JSON files contain ONLY exogenous variables** - the inputs that describe how the bond behaves
- **NO calculated values** like YTM, duration, spread, present value, etc. should ever be stored in the bond JSON
- **Calculator takes JSON + market price ‚Üí calculates analytics in real-time**

### What Goes IN the Bond JSON:
‚úÖ **Bond Definition:**
- Issuer, CUSIP, ISIN
- Face value, coupon rate, issue/maturity dates
- Payment frequency, day count convention
- Callable/puttable/amortizing flags

‚úÖ **Cash Flow Schedule:**
- Payment dates
- Coupon amounts
- Principal payments
- Payment types (COUPON, AMORTIZATION, MATURITY, CALL, PUT)

‚úÖ **Bond Behavior Rules:**
- Call/put schedules
- Amortization schedules  
- Coupon rate changes

### What NEVER Goes in Bond JSON:
‚ùå **Calculated Analytics:**
- Yield to Maturity (YTM)
- Duration, convexity
- Spread to Treasury
- Present value, dirty/clean price
- Accrued interest

### Why This Matters:
1. **Clean Separation:** Bond definition vs. market-dependent calculations
2. **Reusability:** Same bond JSON works for any market price/settlement date
3. **Accuracy:** Analytics always calculated fresh from current market data
4. **Transparency:** Users see exactly what drives the calculation

### Implementation:
- Build bond ‚Üí Generate JSON with cash flows ‚Üí **SAVE** to repository or **EXPORT** for download
- Load bond JSON ‚Üí Input market price ‚Üí Calculate analytics
- JSON files are portable and contain complete bond definition
- Calculator is pure function: `f(bondJSON, marketPrice, settlementDate) ‚Üí analytics`

### Critical Distinction - SAVE vs EXPORT:
- **SAVE**: Stores bond JSON in repository (`saved_bonds/`) for later use in calculator
- **EXPORT**: Downloads bond files to user's computer for external use
- Bond Builder **SAVE** button ‚Üí repository storage
- Analytics Panel **EXPORT** buttons ‚Üí user downloads

This principle must NEVER be violated. Bond JSONs describe behavior, not results.
