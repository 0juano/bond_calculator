[x] current yield is broken, the 2038 is showing 0.068% instead of 6.8% (i think should be around there)
[x] **Number formatting â€“ 2-dec + thousands separators**  
    â€¢ âœ… Updated components to use centralized `formatNumber()` and `formatPercent()` from bond-utils
    â€¢ âœ… Applied consistent 2-decimal formatting with thousands separators throughout
    â€¢ âœ… Replaced inline `.toFixed()` calls with proper Intl.NumberFormat usage

[x] **Metric tooltips ("â“˜")**  
    â€¢ âœ… Created reusable `<InfoTooltip />` component using Radix UI tooltips
    â€¢ âœ… Added tooltips to all key metrics: Modified Duration, Convexity, DV01, etc.
    â€¢ âœ… Included concise definitions like "Price sensitivity: âˆ‚Price/âˆ‚Yield Ã— 100"

[x] **Fix DV01 calculation**  
    â€¢ âœ… Verified DV01 calculation already uses correct formula: `modDur * price * 0.0001`
    â€¢ âœ… Both production and core calculators implement the proper formula

[x] **Section title tweak**  
    â€¢ âœ… Changed "Risk Metrics" title to "Key Metrics"

[x] **Layout & new cash-flow panel**
