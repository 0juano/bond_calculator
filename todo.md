## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Active Development

### Treasury Cache Frontend Migration (BLOCKING PUBLIC LAUNCH)
**Status**: Backend complete, frontend migration needed
**Impact**: Users currently need FRED API keys - blocks public adoption

[ ] **Frontend Migration Tasks**:
  - [ ] Update Treasury hook to use `/api/treasury-rates` instead of `/api/ust-curve`
  - [ ] Remove FRED_API_KEY from client environment variables
  - [ ] Add "Treasury rates as of [date]" display in UI
  - [ ] Show stale data warning when rates >3 days old
  - [ ] Test calculator works without any API keys

[ ] **Production Deployment**:
  - [ ] Set up cron job for automatic updates (hourly or daily)
  - [ ] Add retry logic for FRED API failures
  - [ ] Configure admin notification for stale cache >7 days
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hook to warn about stale treasury data

### Hero Search Landing Page 
**Status**: Design ready, implementation pending
**Impact**: Major UX improvement - transforms calculator into search-first experience

[ ] **Implementation Tasks**:
  - [ ] Extract search into standalone `BondSearch.tsx` component
  - [ ] Create hero layout with centered search bar
  - [ ] Implement progressive disclosure (search ‚Üí grid reveal)
  - [ ] Add `/` hotkey for search focus
  - [ ] Add Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions
  - [ ] Optimize for mobile with responsive search sizing



## üéØ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Ready for Development

### Visual Harmonization Completion
**Status**: Navigation complete, theming pending
**Impact**: Professional cohesion between Calculator and Builder

[ ] **Navigation Flow**:
  - [ ] Update Calculator "‚Üê Back" button logic
  - [ ] Add "‚Üê Back to Calculator" button in Builder
  - [ ] Implement "Build Complete" ‚Üí `/calculator/:newBondId` redirect

[ ] **Shared Theme System**:
  - [ ] Create `theme.ts` with centralized color palette
  - [ ] Extract reusable `Panel.tsx` component
  - [ ] Apply consistent styling to both Calculator and Builder
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded colors with theme variables


## üîß REFACTORING & TECHNICAL DEBT

### Calculator State Management (Step 3)
**Status**: Steps 1-2 complete, final step remaining
**Impact**: Clean architecture, maintainability

[ ] **Create Calculation Service**:
  - [ ] Extract YTM/price/spread calculations into `CalculatorService`
  - [ ] Move complex logic out of React hook
  - [ ] Reduce `useCalculatorState` to ~100 lines of pure state management

### XIRR Architecture Cleanup
**Status**: System works but naming is misleading
**Impact**: Code clarity

[ ] **Cleanup Tasks**:
  - [ ] Remove unused `current-solver.ts`
  - [ ] Rename "dual" references since we're XIRR-only now
  - [ ] Simplify `dual-ytm-display.tsx` component

### Storage Consolidation
**Status**: Multiple implementations exist
**Impact**: Simplified API, easier maintenance

[ ] **Unify Storage**:
  - [ ] Merge storage.ts, storage-temp.ts, bond-storage.ts
  - [ ] Create adapter pattern for file/database backends
  - [ ] Simplify API routes

### Code Organization
**Status**: Large files need splitting
**Impact**: Better maintainability

[ ] **Split Large Files**:
  - [ ] Break 800+ line routes.ts into domain files
  - [ ] Centralize constants and magic numbers
  - [ ] Standardize error handling
